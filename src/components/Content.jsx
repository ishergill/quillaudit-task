          CarpeDiem Pension&apos;s Challenges: Enhancing Security Against
          Reentrancy, Front-Running, and Infinite Minting
        </h2>
        <p>
          CarpeDiem Pension confronts critical security challenges, including
          the risks of reentrancy and front-running exploits.Malicious actors
          may exploit contract vulnerabilities, withdrawing excess funds or
          manipulating transaction timing for unfair advantages. System faces
          infinite minting threats, risking economic stability with endless
          creation of CDP tokens or pension shares.Â  Addressing these challenges
          is paramount to safeguarding the integrity and security of CarpeDiem
          Pension.

        <h2>QuillAudits&apos; Strategic Approach to CDP Security Audits</h2>
        <p>
          We prioritize threat modeling based on platform-specific risks.
          Security-first, we identify and mitigate vulnerabilities beyond
          functionality testing. Using white-box and black-box tests, we conduct
          thorough vulnerability assessments. Maintaining transparency, we
          communicate openly with the CDP team. Emphasizing clarity, we present
          actionable insights for efficient issue resolution.
        </p>
        <h2>Comprehensive Audit Discoveries and Remediation Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the audit process, we unearthed a total of 33 issues,
          spanning from minor concerns to critical vulnerabilities. Among these,
          some of the critical issues identified were: Here&apos;s how we
          remediated them :
        </p>
        <h4>1. Unauthorized Claim/Compound:</h4>
        <span>
          a. Users could claim/compound a substantial amount without making a
          deposit or waiting for the stipulated time
        </span>
        <h4>2. Precision Loss in mintCDP():</h4>
        <span>
          a. Precision loss and unscaled values were identified while
          calculating rewardPerShare in the mintCDP() function.
        </span>
        <h4>3. Multiplication Accuracy:</h4>
        <span>
          a. Multiplication operations were prone to providing incorrect answers
          due to unscaled values, posing a potential risk to accurate
          calculations.
        </span>
        <h4>4. Incorrect Share Allocation:</h4>
        <span>
          a. The protocol was allocating shares for all days, even when there
          were no corresponding deposits, leading to inefficient use of
          resources.
        </span>
        <h4>5. Logic Error in Referral Handling:</h4>
        <span>
          a. A logic error resulted in users always having their user.referral
          set to address(0), which could be exploited to trick the referral
          system
        </span>
        <h4>6. Referral Exploitation:</h4>
        <span>
          a. Users could exploit the referral system to extract more CDP from
          the protocol, undermining its integrity.
        </span>
        <h2>Remediation & Impact:</h2>
        <p>
          All identified vulnerabilities were addressed by the CDP team,
          significantly enhancing the smart contract&apos;s security posture.
          Key improvements include
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementation of reentrancy protection mechanisms.</li>
          <li>
            Accurate handling of decimal values using established libraries or
            best practices.
          </li>
          <li>Revised calculations with proper scaling factors</li>
          <li>
            Fixing logic errors to ensure deposits and waiting periods are
            enforced.
          </li>
          <li>Addressing referral system vulnerabilities to prevent abuse.</li>
        </ul>
